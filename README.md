# Test which MIME-types your browser supports

[**Deployed via GitHub Pages**](https://lukaskalbertodt.github.io/mime-test/)

This is a super simple webapp to check your browsers capabilities regarding media recording support.
The `MediaRecorder` API is the foundation for all of this.
This app shows you if `MediaRecorder`, `getUserMedia` and `getDisplayMedia` is supported and which MIME-types are supported by the `MediaRecorder`.
